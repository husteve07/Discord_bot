purge command : purge @(person) (number)

the bot is granted with the power to drag people in voice calls
The pinged (person) gets dragged between 2 premade voice channels every 2 times in a second, after(number) times of being dragged the command ends.
if the (person) is ethan, he will get kicked by the bot after command ends
if the (person) is nicholas, ella, or steve, the person who sends the command will get purged (number) times.
if the (person) is not in call, bot sends message:
"(person) is not connected to a voice cahnnel, execution cannot begin"

if the(person) leaves the call before command ends, (person) gets kicked by the bot
the bot will then send an invite link to (person)


infinite purge : infinite_tsukuyomi @(person)
inherits all attributes from purge command, except the person pinged will get purged indefinitly.
Hence the only way to stop it is either the person being purged leaves the call or host manually exits the bot
